Hey, stop for a second!
Here's a hint: You can talk to people by tapping (clicking) on them!
So I helped you, will you help me?|What with?|Too busy
There's an apple up there above us, but I'm too low on magic to teleport up there and get it myself. Could you get it for me?|Sure|Too busy
Well that's too bad
Wait, you already ate the apple?!?
Huh? You have it already?! That's amazing! Here, gimme a second to clean this up
Oh thank you!
Well that's too bad
You really shouldn't eat things you find like that! That apple had bad magic in it, it could've hurt you!
>The wizard cleans the apple|Well, have a good day!|Hey, have you heard of Logolio?
Wait, you should take this! It's all clean now.
Oh, sure! You can get to him by continuing on forwards the way you were headed
Take this apple with you, it'll give you energy! You'll need it if you're going to confront Logolio.

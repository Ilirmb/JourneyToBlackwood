Hi there! Have we met before?
Oh, was there an apple while you were up there?|Well,
An apple for me? Oh you're too kind! I was looking for this, actually.
Wait, did you eat it?
>The wizard cleans the apple up 
You can't just eat everything you find! It was filled with pooooison! You could've been hurt! Be more careful in the future!
Thank you, that was very kind of you|No prob bob|Hey, happen to know where Logolio is?
Here, you can have this. It's all cleaned up now.
Oh sure! Just keep going down until you hit the river with the beavers, and continue on. You're on the right path!
Here, you should take the apple if you're going after Logolio. You might need the energy.

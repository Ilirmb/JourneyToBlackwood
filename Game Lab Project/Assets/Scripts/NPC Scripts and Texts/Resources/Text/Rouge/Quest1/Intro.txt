Drow|You see a sleeping drow|Approach him|Leave him alone
Player|Hey, are you OK?
Player|I should leave him alone. He'll probably be fine, and I need to get going towards Logolio as soon as possible.
Drow|>The drow awakens with a start, panicing for a moment before quickly calming himself, his embarrasment clear on his face.
Drow|Oh, hello there. I didn't see you. What are you doing down this deep?
Player|I need to find a way out of here.
Drow|Then maybe we can help each other. I know a way out of here, but I need a bit of help myself.|Sure, I can help.|Sorry, too busy.
Player|Whats the problem?
Player|Sorry, I can't. I've got to get going if I'm going to get to Logolio.
Drow|>The dark elf gestures to their foot.
Drow|>The dark elf nods a few times understandingly as you turn to leave.
Drow|Well firstly I need a pixie to heal my foot. No point in freeing myself yet if I can't walk anyway. Also, we're going to need a rope if we're going to get out of here.
Player|Ok! I'll be back soon.
